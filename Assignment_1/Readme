Used python 2.7 and thrift pip package for python
Generated gen-py using chord.thrift.

server.sh runs 'python server.py $1'

Run server using:
./server.sh PORT_NUM
Ex:
./server.sh 9090

If no port is specified, server will try to run on port 9090.
server.py has a global variable LOG_TO_FILE which will output all print statements to
a log file if True. If False, then print statements will be sent to stdout.

No makefile is required since nothing is compiled.
